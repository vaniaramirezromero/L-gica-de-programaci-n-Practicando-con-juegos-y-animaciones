# Logica-de-programacion-Practicando-con-juegos-y-animaciones
Take this course for the Oracle ONE Education program - Programming Logic: Practicing with Games and Animations

****Where I learned:****

- To use the `Canvas` as a blackboard where we made our designs.
- To design geometric figures like rectangles and circles.
- To customize some properties of our figures like color.
- To use functions to encapsulate the creation of shapes.
- To use *Loop* cycles to repeat activities when we create our shapes.
- To interact with the user through events.
- To associate functions with events and to capture event properties to pass them as parameters.
- How to make simple animations.
- How to clean the screen using `clearRect()`.
- To call functions at a certain time interval with `setInterval()`.
- Create an interactive game.
- Round numbers with a new function `Math.floor()`.
- To abstract a problem to propose a logical solution through an algorithm.
- To use several logic concepts in a single program, such as functions, conditions, event capturing, *Loop* cycles, etc.
